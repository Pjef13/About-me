# About-me
About me, the first step on my programming and developer journey.
I am a Mathematics and Physics teacher in a secondary school in Australia.
I am curious about the world of tech and the prospect of pursuing a career or side hustle in tech, although this seems quite a long way off at this moment (Jan/25).
I hope to learn while on Github!
